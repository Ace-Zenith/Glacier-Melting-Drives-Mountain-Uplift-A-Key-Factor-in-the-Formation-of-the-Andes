* This repository only contains the necessary codes for our 2-D convectional simulation. 

* There are three types of files, the .prm files are the source codes of ASPECT which could run on Linux platforms. The open-source code ASPECT (v2.4.0) (Bangerth et al., 2022) is available for download on GitHub (https:/github.com/geodynamics/aspect/releases/tag/v2.4.0) or Zenodo(https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5131909). The .wb file could run by the code Geodynamic World Builder (v0.4.0) (Fraters et al., 2019) which is used to build the models is available for download on GitHub (https://github.com/GeodynamicWorldBuilder/WorldBuilder/releases/tag/v
0.4.0) or Zenode (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5014808). The prem.txt is a gravity profile that follows the description o f the preliminary reference Earth model (PREM) by Dziewonski & Anderson (1981), https://doi.org/10.1016/0031-9201(81)90046-7.

* The source codes of the plugins are written on the basis of the codes provided by the fully-open finite element code: Advanced Solver for Problems in Earth's ConvecTion, ASPECT. And tested with the ASPECT-2.3.0.

* As for the rest of source codes running the simulation, they can be accessed through: https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect
  
* This simulation runs on Linux platforms, for example, CentOS/Ubuntu LTS. Before running, refer to the relevant manual (https://www.math.clemson.edu/~heister/manual.pdf) to download, install and configure the necessary running environments.
